## conventional commits

this project follows conventional commit standards to ensure clear and consistent commit messages.

### setup

to enable commit message validation:

1. copy the hook script to your local git hooks:

   ```bash
   cp scripts/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg
   chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
   ```

### commit message format

commit messages must follow this format:

* start with a type: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `revert:`
* followed by a space and a lowercase description
* first line â‰¤60 characters

example: `feat: add user authentication`

### history cleanup

if you need to clean up existing commit messages (make lowercase and truncate), use the rewrite script:

```bash
bash scripts/rewrite_msg.sh
```

for rewriting the entire history:

```bash
git filter-branch --msg-filter 'bash scripts/rewrite_msg.sh' -- --all
```

note: this rewrites history, so use with caution and force-push if necessary.
