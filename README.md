## Conventional Commits

This project follows conventional commit standards to ensure clear and consistent commit messages.

### Setup

To enable commit message validation:

1. Copy the hook script to your local git hooks:
   ```bash
   cp scripts/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg
   chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
   ```

### Commit Message Format

Commit messages must follow this format:
- Start with a type: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `perf:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `revert:`
- Followed by a space and a lowercase description
- First line â‰¤60 characters

Example: `feat: add user authentication`

### History Cleanup

If you need to clean up existing commit messages (make lowercase and truncate), use the rewrite script:

```bash
bash scripts/rewrite_msg.sh
```

For rewriting the entire history:

```bash
git filter-branch --msg-filter 'bash scripts/rewrite_msg.sh' -- --all
```

Note: This rewrites history, so use with caution and force-push if necessary.
